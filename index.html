          Skateboarding has effected my life in so many ways, but mainly changing the way I go about problems. Instead of 
          being ashamed I failed, I get back up and strive to do better. Skating has changed my mentality to be much better,
          failing for me isn't a bad thing, its a step to eventually succeed. I want to talk about skating and share my experiences with it.

          <h1> Culture </h1>

          <p class="styled">
            Street Skating became a icon of non-comformity, doing what the people want. With its heavy roots in punk at the start.
            Skating was rebelious.

          <h1> Fashion </h1>

          <p class="styled">
            Skate fashion can vary heavily, but it mainly takes inspiration from some of the first Street-Skaters who wore baggy clothing.
            Baggy clothing also helps prevent scrapes/scratches and provides comfort when stretching and doing specific tricks.
